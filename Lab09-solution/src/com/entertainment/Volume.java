/*
 * Lab - Interfaces
 * 
 * This interface defines the Volume role.
 *
 * Objects that implement this interface are known to
 * have "volume controllability," i.e., setVolume, getVolume, mute, isMuted.
 * 
 * Television (and thus its subclasses) implements this interface.
 * So does class Radio.
 * 
 * Note that, although Television and Radio have no 
 * inheritance relationship, they do play the same role, in 
 * that they are both "volume controllable."  Hence, a Television
 * and a Radio can both be treated as simply instances
 * of Volume, an interface type.
