/*
 * Lab - Interfaces
 *
 * This class is the main class, i.e., where the application starts.
 * 
 * It demonstrates polymorphism and interface types by creating a
 * Volume (interface type) array, adding a Television, a ColorTelevision,
 * a PortableTelevision, and a Radio to it, and calling toString on each one.
 *
 * Even though Radio and Television (and its subclasses) are not
 * inheritance-related, they both fulfill the Volume "role."
